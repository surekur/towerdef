# About

Nothing particularly interesting to see here, just a silly unfinished game. Move on people!

# Instalation

The program only depends on python3 and pygame. 
If you are running a modern operating system you alredy have python3
installed on your system.
To install pygame run:

```
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```

Then you just execute main.py, and the game should run.
